# Server Directory (Hosting the Application)

It is advisable to have the this directory sorted out prior to the `react/` directory. Follow the instructions in that directory's README file after completing this one.

In order to get the application running locally on your host machine, this directory needs the node modules sorted out prior to sorting the `react/` directory.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Should you encounter issues installing the node modules, delete the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file and reinstall the node modules.

```bash
$ rm -rf node_modules
$ rm package-lock.json
$ npm install
```
